    - **Staten Island** has the **lowest number of listings** compared to all other neighborhood groups, with a **huge difference**.  
    - Despite that, it has the **highest number of reviews**.  
    - It also ranks **third in Reviews-to-Price ratio**, with only a very small gap compared to the top groups.  

    **Implication:**  
    Staten Island generates **nearly the same revenue as other neighborhood groups** despite having far fewer listings.  

    If the number of listings in Staten Island increases, the overall revenue is very likely to increase as well.

### Insights from Neighborhood Group & Room Type Analysis

- In **Manhattan**, although the **Entire Home/Apartment** room type is the most common, it has the **least number of reviews** (even fewer than Shared Rooms).  
- Its slightly higher value in terms of **Approximate Profit** comes mainly from its **much higher price** compared to the other two room types, not because of stronger demand.  
- This suggests that in **Manhattan**, it would be better to **invest more in Private Rooms** rather than Entire Homes.  

- On the other hand, in the **other four Neighborhood Groups** (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island), the pattern is **opposite**:  
  - Although the number of **Entire Home/Apartment** listings is smaller than Private Rooms,  
  - They receive **more reviews** and achieve a **higher Approximate Profit**.  
  - This implies that in these four groups, it would be better to **increase the number of Entire Homes**.  
  

- Interestingly, we also observed that although the **number of listings for Shared Rooms** is very low across all five neighborhood groups, the **number of reviews for Shared Rooms is surprisingly high**, sometimes **competing with or even exceeding other room types**, especially in **Manhattan**.  
  This implies that **expanding Shared Rooms in Manhattan** could be a promising strategy.

### Insights from Minimum Charge Analysis
When plotting **Minimum Charge** on the x-axis against either **Number of Reviews** or **Approximate Profit** on the y-axis, we observed a clear trend:

Higher reviews and higher Approximate Profit values tend to occur at **relatively lower Minimum Charges**.
Only a few exceptions deviate from this trend.
This suggests that **affordable listings tend to attract more bookings and better performance in terms of revenue**.

### Insights from Host Listings Count Analysis
We observed that both **Approximate Profit** and **Number of Reviews** decrease as the **Host Listings Count** increases beyond a certain threshold (around 50 listings).

Possible explanations include:

Guests may **trust large-scale hosts less**, preferring smaller or individual hosts.
Hosts with many listings may **struggle to maintain quality**, leading to fewer reviews and lower performance.

We found that the **number of listings** is higher in **coastal areas** compared to non-coastal areas.
However:

The **number of reviews** is greater in non-coastal areas despite having fewer listings.
The **Approximate Profit** is slightly higher for coastal areas, mainly due to much higher prices rather than higher review engagement.
This suggests that **non-coastal areas may be a better investment opportunity**, as they attract more reviews relative to their smaller number of listings, indicating stronger demand and engagement despite fewer listings.
